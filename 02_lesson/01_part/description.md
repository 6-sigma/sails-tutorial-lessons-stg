Let's implement a simple fungible token contract. This contract will manage user balances and mint new tokens.

Start by introducing a service that initializes the token name during contract deployment. The service will also include a method to return the specified name.

Here's the step-by-step explanation:

1. Structure Definition: The `State` structure stores the token name.
2. Static State Storage: A static variable holds the state. Before initialization, `STATE` is `None`, allowing for the possibility of the storage being uninitialized.
3. Storage Implementation: The `State` struct has a `get` method that returns a reference to the storage.
4. Token Service Implementation: The `Token` struct is marked as a service with the `#[service]` attribute.
    - **Initialization (`init` method)**: Takes a `String` parameter `name` and initializes the static storage with this name.
    - **Name Retrieval (`name` method)**: Returns the name stored in the static storage.
5. Program Implementation: The previous lesson only added a service constructor. Here, an application constructor is added. Associated public functions returning `Self` are treated as application constructors and are called once at the beginning of the applicationâ€™s lifetime when the application is loaded onto the network.
    - **Application Constructor (`new` method)**: Initializes the token with the specified name by calling `Token::init` and returns an instance of `MyProgram`.
    - **Token Service Access (`token` method)**: Returns a default instance of the `Token` struct.
    - Another crucial concept is message routing. This concept doesn't have a mandatory representation in the code but can be altered using the `#[route]` attribute applied to associated public functions. Message routing is about rules for dispatching an incoming request message to a specific service's method using service and method names. If the `#[route("token")]` attribute was not used above the application constructor of the token service, then the service is exposed as `TokenSvc`. With the `#[route("token")]` macro, it is exposed as `Token`.
